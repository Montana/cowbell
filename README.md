Get a push notification from Prowl when someone has a "verified" account that enters your store. This in conjunction will be used obviously with the Facebook API, and the Twitter API. It will also be stored as a JSON file, and look something similar to this 
 
<pre>
{
 "Verified Persons": "Montana Mendy",
 "Authenticatation": "Oauth2.0",
 "Result": "Success"
}</pre>

Work in progress
